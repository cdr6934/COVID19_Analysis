The following analysis is taking the US / Global Cases of COVID19 and using the data to draw some insights of the data. Throughout this analysis we are curious on understanding these cases throughout the last couple years to provide context and to help identify patterns within the data that could help provide legislators or health professionals the opportunity to make changes. Much of the work was done by following what Dr Wall has done for us. So in addition to the questions Dr Wall asked, how does the cases / 1000 differ between States? We will be focusing on Tennessee and New York as an interesting comparison between the states.
